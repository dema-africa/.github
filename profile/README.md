### Hello

Welcome to Dema Africa. This project started as a passion of [Silas Jimmy](https://github.com/silasjimmy) to raise awareness on the importance of healthy eating habits. Basically, the idea is to create a platform where people can have access to locally available foods as well as connect them to nearby eateries. The goals of this project are:

1. Amass a vast database of locally available foods in Kenya
2. Create a platform where people can plan balanced diets
3. Connect people to nearby eateries
4. Promote awareness on healthy eating habits

If you like what we are doing please reach out and let us make this a reality!
