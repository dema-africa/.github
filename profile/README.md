### Howdy there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the Dema project. This project started as a passion of [Silas Jimmy](https://github.com/silasjimmy) to raise awareness on the importance of healthy eating habits. Basically, the idea is to create a platform where folks can utilize to plan balanced diets and make goals based on their objectives. The goals of this project are:

1. Catalogue all the local foods available

We are just getting started, so it might not be much done as of now but it is a work in progress. Also, the project focusses on the Kenya population but we look forward to expand to other regions.

If you like what we are doing please reach out and let us make this a reality!
