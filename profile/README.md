# Hello world!

This is us, the Dema organization. Dema is a project that aims to provide a solution to 2 of the (17 UN Sustainable Development Goals)[https://sdgs.un.org/goals] - 2. **Zero hunger** and 3. **Good health and well being** - through technology. The following are the main development objectives of the project:

1. Creating a meal planning system
2. Implementing a weight watcher
3. Incorporate a food journal
4. Add a digital coach/assistant

We recognize the awesome meal planners, weight watchers and food journal apps that exist. Therefore the project is not to re-invent the wheel but add more advanced and personalized features to the existing tools. For more information, check out our (website)[https://demawebsite.web.app/].
